## Introduction:
 [The Movie Grab](https://github.com/ttdunlap33/movie-project)

## User Story
```It’s movie night. I feel I have exhausted all my entertainment options between TV and streaming services.I just want some recommendations based off of my favorite movies. That will display the top 5 recommendations. That also provides a poster, a brief description of the movie from wikipedia and an accompanying movie trailer for my convenience. ```

## Criteria
Project 1 was to build web applications from scratch. With a team, to conceive and execute a design by integrating data received from multiple server-side API requests. While working collaboratively, to learn agile development methodologies and implement features and bug fixes using the git branch workflow and pull requests.
